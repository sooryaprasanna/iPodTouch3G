This guide is for Mac Silicon:
- Extract the zip to a convenient location e.g. your Downloads folder.
- Plug your device into your computer.
- Extract the compressed download.
- Run g1lbertJB to start the jailbreaking process:
  - In Terminal, navigate to the path and run ./g1lbertJB.command
  - Once your phone has rebooted once, open the g1lbertJB app on your home screen when prompted. g1lbertJB will reboot your device one last time.
  - If you receive the message "Error Code 1" and/or "Error Code 102" during the jailbreak, this is normal and can be ignored.

Once you see your lock screen, you should be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen.
